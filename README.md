More than 700 MetaPost example diagrams for a mathematics book.

Run "make" to make the file mpdemo.pdf.

These MetaPost examples demonstrate a wide range of MetaPost's capabilities.

These examples are not a tutorial, but you could use them as a <q>MetaPost cookbook</q>.

My [4-volume 2000-page mathematics book](http://www.geometry.org/tex/conc/dgchaps.html) uses most of these diagrams.
